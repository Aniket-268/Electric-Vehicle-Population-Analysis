#  Electric Vehicle Population Analysis

##  Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) population data to understand adoption trends, regional distribution, and market growth. It focuses on transforming raw EV registration data into actionable insights using data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques.

The goal is to identify how electric vehicles are spreading across different regions and how factors such as vehicle type, manufacturer, and model year impact EV adoption.
